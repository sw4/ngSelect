Angular Based Visually Customisable Select Input


Requires jQuery, Angular, FontAwesome (optional CSS).

To use, inglude `ngSelect.js` after Angular and jQuery in your page, as well as `ngSelect.css` in your `head`.

Simply add the class `ngSelect` to any select input currently linked to Angular, it will be replaced with a custom element which can be styled with CSS and mirrors the original select input in terms of model and controller bindings.

**Important Note**
Code is unclean and not optimised.
