To use, inglude ngSelect.js after Angular and jQuery in your page as well as ngSelect.css in your `head`.

Simply add the class `ngSelect` to any select input currently linked to Angular, it will be replaced with a custom element which can be styled with CSS and mirrors the original select input in terms of model and controller bindings.
